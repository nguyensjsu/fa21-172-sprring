## Design
* The whole project is separated into four main division: three microservices and one backend RestAPI.
* The RestAPI is implemented and deployed On GKE beforehand for microservices to make use of.
* Each microservices is written within it's own folder and main running class, executing separately.
* However, all microservices shares the same MySQL database through the backend API for consistency.
