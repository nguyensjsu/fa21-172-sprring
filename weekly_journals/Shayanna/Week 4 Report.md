# Week 4 Report - Shayanna

On 12/1, I fix some minor mistakes found on the *Login* and *Sign Up* page. Then, I went on to create the menu page where the customer will order drinks, and adjust the drink size and whether he or she wants to make their drink a regular tea or milk tea drink. These are just the basic adjustments we chose to implement at the moment before building upon the application.

On 12/5, the team gets on another Discord call meeting to work on the project together.
