# Week 2 Report - Shayanna

On 11/10, the group had a meeting on Discord again to reconvene on the research we did since the last meeting. We finally decided to base our project off of Gong Cha because it has a similar business model as Starbucks (i.e., both companies serve coffee and tea). Nhu had a little trouble on designing the RestAPI, so we had a discussion on how to go about it. 

11/16
nhu enters office hours to ask about architecture
found out he recommends a microservice architecture rather than monolithic structure we initially thought
so we all had to look into how to convert the rest api we already had in order to fit microservice architecture
