# Week 6 Report - Shayanna

On 12/14 and 12/16, I worked with Nhu to make the back office function, which is allowing the customer to change his or her password to his or her account. From the customer view, the user will send a request to change the password to the back office. An employee in the back office will then approve the request, and save this update to the database. I also worked with the other members on the order and payment page.

On 12/17, the group met on Discord to test the application together and also record the demo video.
