# Week 1 Report - Shayanna

On 10/13, the group did a group call on Discord for introductions, to choose a group name, and to decide on a brand we will base the project off of. Our team name ended up being SpRRiNg because the capital letters represented the initals of all of our first names. We all went over the project guidelines on Canvas together to make sure we were all on the same page. We then split off to research how we should deisgn the architecture of the application, knowing that we would eventually need to deploy it on Google Cloud.

On 11/4, we further talked about the architecture and had initial guesses to implement a monolithic structure by having multiple controllers, repositories, and models within the same folder. Rozanna and Nhu communicated with the professor on Slack about his thoughts on this design and further advice. We all split up work on looking into the different components in the monolithic architecture. Nhu wanted to work on the RestAPI, Ryan wanted to work on the backend code, and Rozanna and I wanted to work on the frontend together. Nhu would also helped the rest of us out after implementing the RestAPI.
